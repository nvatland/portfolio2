title: About Me
subhead: Puzzle-loving developer.
description_html: <p>I am a Webby Award-Winning front-end web developer with an eye for design. I am currently a UI & UX Designer for Walt Disney Animation Studios based in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>I attended The Art Institute of California - San Diego, earning a BS for Graphic & Web Design, and interned at Walt Disney Animation Studios and Disney Corporate Creative Resources.</p><p>I love bringing designs to life through code while adding surprise and delight moments through animations. I'm passionate about creating experiences that are usable, accessible, responsive, and enjoyable. Recently, I've fallen in love with creating "scrollytelling" websites, using scroll-based animations to guide a user through an experience.</p><p>Beyond my love of code, I also have experience creating motion graphics, print design, photography, and video editing.</p>
