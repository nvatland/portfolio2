title: Disney Animation Redesign
excerpt: Website redesign for Walt Disney Animation Studios.
description: <p>This project won a Webby People's Voice Award in the Television and Film category in 2021.</p><p>Walt Disney Animation Studios has a rich legacy dating back to <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>. We were tasked with updating Walt Disney Animation Studios' website to showcase the people, legacy, technology, careers, and work at the studio. Using animations to provide moments of delight (like the hamburger menu Mickey) to color-coordinating each section of the site to orient the user, this redesign brought new life and enjoyment to the Walt Disney Animation Studios website.</p><p>This site was built using Jekyll, SASS, GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and JavaScript. It also uses CloudCannon as a CMS to allow for easy adjustments and updates.</p>
