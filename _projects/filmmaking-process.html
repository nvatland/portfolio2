title: Filmmaking Process
excerpt: A behind the scenes look at Disney Animation's filmmaking process.
description: <p>An animated film is made up of many still images that come together to create the final picture you see on screen. Each image is hand-crafted by many departments throughout Walt Disney Animation Studios. This complex and iterative process is brought to life on the Filmmaking Process page, highlighting the different contributions behind the scenes.</p><p>I was the sole developer on this project and also helped in the design phase creating different wireframes, comps, and animations.</p><p>This site was built using Jekyll, SASS, GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and JavaScript. It also uses CloudCannon as a CMS to allow for easy adjustments and updates.</p>
