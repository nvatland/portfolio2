excerpt: Celebrating 100 years of Walt Disney Animation Studios.
description: >-
  To celebrate 100 years of Walt Disney Animation Studios, we created a special
  landing page highlighting a moment from every film since 1923.


  This site was built using Jekyll, SASS, GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and JavaScript.
  It also uses CloudCannon as a CMS to allow for easy adjustments and updates.
