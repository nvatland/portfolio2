title: Disney Animation Careers Social
excerpt: Social media posts for Disney Animation Careers.
description: <p>The Disney Animation Careers social media platforms are used to promote current job openings, highlight people at the studio, inform people about upcoming events Disney Animation will be at, and showcase upcoming work. Throughout my time at Disney Animation, I have managed the social calendar and strategy, as well as created posts for the social channels.</p><p>Each post is created using a range of software including Photoshop, Illustrator, AfterEffects, Premiere, and Adobe XD. Prior to the pandemic, I would also set up and record people recording for B-roll to add in to the posts.</p>
